Task: Create a latex file with generated gnuplots using the make utility tool.

I have thought of two ways to accomplish this goal; both using cairolatex
terminal in gnuplot.

1) To generate a pdf file easily included in the latex file using graphicx.
  Pros: Easy to customise size of plot in latex file by using the graphicx package.
  Cons: Will not share font etc. with entire latex document by default.

2) To generate a tex file (not standalone) to be included using \input in main latex file
  Pros: Will share format settings of the mother document
  Cons: Difficult to set size? Will have to know size, then hardcode it in
  gnuplot?

Trying the 2nd solution, I stumbled upon the following problem.

Problem: Makefile seems unable to escape a double backslash sequence: \\
